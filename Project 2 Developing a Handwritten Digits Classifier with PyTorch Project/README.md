# Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Deep Learning

## Introduction

With the advancements in machine learning and deep learning, we now have powerful tools for tasks such as computer vision. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is one of the crucial areas where deep learning has shown significant promise, especially in recognizing handwritten characters. This project serves as a proof of concept for the broader task of OCR using the renowned MNIST database of handwritten digits.

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate the capability of deep learning techniques in recognizing handwritten digits, which will later be extrapolated to a more comprehensive OCR system for recognizing various handwritten characters.

## What's Included

1. **Jupyter Notebook**: The primary workspace for this project. You'll find all the necessary code snippets, written explanations, and visualizations here. Please ensure you have Jupyter installed to run the notebook.
2. **Dataset**: The MNIST database of handwritten digits. It includes a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 0 to 9.

## Steps to Follow

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Before feeding the dataset to our model, we need to ensure that it's in the right shape and format. This step will guide you on how to preprocess the MNIST dataset for optimal results.
2. **Building the Neural Network**: You will construct a deep learning model suitable for the task. This section will provide an overview of the architecture and why specific choices were made.
3. **Training the Model**: With our data ready and our model in place, we will train our neural network on the MNIST dataset. This step involves feeding the data into the model, adjusting the weights, and minimizing the loss.
4. **Tuning and Optimization**: Post the initial training, you'll explore methods to improve the model's performance further. This might involve changing the architecture, adjusting hyperparameters, or employing regularization techniques.
5. **Evaluation**: After training and tuning, you'll evaluate the model's performance on the test set to get a sense of its accuracy and robustness.
