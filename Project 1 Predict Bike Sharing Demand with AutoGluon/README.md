# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction with AutoGluon

## Project Overview

In this project, we utilize the power of the AutoGluon library to tackle the Bike Sharing Demand competition on Kaggle. Through the use of Tabular Prediction, we process and fit data sourced directly from the competition's provided CSV files. The journey through this project will highlight the ability to train multiple iterations of models using AutoGluon and chronicle the optimization process.

Understanding bike-sharing demand is analogous to numerous real-world scenarios faced by companies like Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash. Accurate demand prediction is paramount for businesses. It not only allows them to brace for sudden surges but also significantly enhances customer experience by minimizing potential delays.
